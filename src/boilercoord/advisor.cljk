(ns boilercoord.advisor
  "Boiler-Plant Scheduling & Logistics Coordination Advisor — the
  advisor named in this repository's README, proposing a boiler-plant
  scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a pressure-log/
  maintenance-record/progress record, schedule a crew/shift
  operation, flag a safety concern, coordinate a supply order) from a
  plant roster, operator roster and plant schedule. Swappable
  mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes — `boilercoord.governor` checks
  plant/operator registration, the closed op-allowlist and scope-
  exclusion independently, and always escalates safety-concern flags,
  above-threshold supply orders and low-confidence proposals. This
  actor coordinates BOILER-PLANT SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never
  operates boiler/steam equipment itself and never proposes to
  finalize a boiler-operation-execution decision (authorizing a
  pressure change/valve operation to proceed), finalize a plant-
  safety-clearance decision, or override a plant safety officer's
  judgment. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-8131's chemcoord.advisor.

   coordinate boiler-plant scheduling and logistics ONLY: never
   propose to finalize a boiler-operation-execution decision
   (authorizing a pressure change/valve operation to proceed), never
   propose to finalize a plant-safety-clearance decision, never
   propose to override a plant safety officer's judgment, and never
   propose an op outside the closed allowlist above. You never
   operate boiler/steam equipment yourself: :coordinate-supply-order
   covers plant-equipment/administrative/spare-parts procurement
   only, never pressure vessels, valves or steam equipment
   themselves. The governor checks plant/operator registration and
   scope independently. Safety-concern flags (pressure-reading
   concern, safety-valve condition, equipment condition) and above-
   threshold supply orders always require human sign-off regardless
   of confidence.")
